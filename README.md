# Practical-Optimisation-Examples
A repository for practical applications of optimisation tools to engineering problems.

Contents:

2D truss optimisation. Area of memebers in 2D truss are optimised to give the lightest structure subject to stress and displacement constraints.

2D column buckling optimisation. Diameter and thickness of tube is optimised to give minimum weight, subject to yield and buckling stress constraints.
